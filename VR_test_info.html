		<h1>Virtual reality</h1>
		<p><strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong> is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays 
		to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include 
		entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and 
		business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented 
		reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are 
		currently changing due to the nascence of the industry.
